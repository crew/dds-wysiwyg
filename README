Twilight
========

Introduction
------------
Twilight is the web frontend for the Northeatern University Crew Digital
Display System.


System Requirements
-------------------
To run Cappuccino applications, all you need is a web browser that understands
JavaScript.

To build Cappuccino itself, please read more here :

  - http://wiki.github.com/280north/cappuccino/getting-and-building-the-source

If you're using Windows, you'll also need Cygwin: http://www.cygwin.com/


Setting Up Obj-J Environment
----------------------------
To build Cappuccino from source, type "rake debug" from within the root of
the Cappuccino directory.  "rake install" will build Cappuccino and associated
tools and install them for general use.


Getting Started
---------------
Once you have the Cappuccino source checked out from git and installed.
Go to the root directory of the wysiwyg project and type "capp gen -f -l",
this will create the 'Frameworks' directory needed for the web app and symlink
the contents to the local Cappuccino build on your system.


Browser Settings / Tools
---------------
 * Make Gecko Just A Little Less Secure
   1. In Firefox type about:config into the Location Bar (address bar) and press Enter.
   2. Click the "I'll be carefull, I promise" button xD
   3. Change the security.fileuri.strict to false

 * Webkit Based Browsers (Safari, Chrome, et al)
   1. For Safari on Mac enter "defaults write com.apple.Safari WebKitDeveloperExtras -bool true"
      in Terminal.app, then relaunch Safari and notice the "Develop" menu.
   2. Chrome has this under the Developer > Developer Tools menu.


Running
-------
In your browser of choice open "index-debug.html" and you should be set to start developing.
When changes are made, just refresh (or 'shift + refresh') to see your changes. Errors will
be displayed in the FireBug or WebKit Developer Tools console.
