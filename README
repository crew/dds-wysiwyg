Twilight
========

Introduction
------------
Twilight is the web frontend for the Northeatern University Crew Digital
Display System.

System Requirements
-------------------
To run Cappuccino applications, all you need is a web browser that understands
JavaScript.

To build Cappuccino itself, you'll need the following tools:

  - Java 1.5: http://www.java.com/
  - Apache Ant: http://ant.apache.org/
  - GCC: http://gcc.gnu.org/

If you're using Windows, you'll also need Cygwin: http://www.cygwin.com/

Finally, if you want to easily stay up to date with the latest developments
and contribute your work back to the Cappuccino community, you'll want to
install Git: http://git-scm.com/
